        When a valid number is selected, it is placed on the right side of the equation at the red position.
        After the next valid operand is selected, the number at the red position shifts to the green position.
        And the number at the green position shifts to the blue position.
        The newly selected number then takes the red position.

        When the three numbers form a correct arithmetic(+-\u00D7\u00F7) equation, you score.
        When you continuously form correct arithmetic equations, you gain chain multiplier.
