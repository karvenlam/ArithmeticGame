        When a valid number is first selected, it appears on the right side of the equation at the red position.
        After the next valid operand is selected, the number at the red position shifts to the green position.
        And the number at the green position shifts to the blue position.
        The newly selected number then takes the red position.
        \n
        When the three numbers form a correct arithmetic(+-\u00D7\u00F7) equation, you earn score.
        When you continuously form correct arithmetic equations, you gain chain multiplier.
        \n
        Valid numbers cannot have leading zeros and cannot intersect each other.
        In Zen mode, two out of three numbers must be at least 2 digits long.
        And each set of numbers must be unique.
        \n
        For addition and subtraction, score=(blue)+(green)+(red).
        For multiplication and division, score=(blue) x (green) x (red).
        The score is then multiplied by the current chain number.

        Valid numbers cannot have leading zeros and cannot intersect each other.
        In Journey mode, one of the numbers must be at least 2 digits long.
        For each valid number selected, one move is deducted. When you runs out of moves, you lose.
        After each correct equation, the selected digits are randomly replaced. Duplicate equations are allowed in this mode.
        \n
        For addition and subtraction, moves = log10(blue)+log10(green)+log10(red).
        For multiplication and division, moves =(log10(blue)+1) x (log10(green)+1) x (log10(red)+1).
        The number of moves is then multiplied by the current chain number.
