    Two out of three numbers must be greater than 10.</string>

    <string name="score_system">For addition and subtraction, score=log10(operand1)+log10(operand2)+log10(result).
        For multiplication and division, score=(log10(operand1)+1) x (log10(operand2)+1) x (log10(result)+1).
        The score is then multiplied by the current chain number.
